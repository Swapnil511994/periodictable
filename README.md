# Introduction

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized based on their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. It provides a systematic way of representing and organizing all known elements in a concise and informative manner.

The modern periodic table was first proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Since then, it has undergone several modifications and refinements based on advancements in scientific knowledge. It has become an essential tool for understanding and studying the elements and their relationships, as well as for guiding research and discoveries in the field of chemistry.
